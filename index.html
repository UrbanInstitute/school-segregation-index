        <div class = "pubDate"><span>March XX, 2020</span></div>
        <p>
        School segregation has proven to be one of America’s most intractable problems—difficult to change and complicated to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
        Traditionally, we talk about segregation by looking at a school’s racial or ethnic makeup. Do Black or Hispanic students learn alongside many white students at their school? If not, it’s typically considered segregated.
        </p>
        <p>
        But this approach misses that all-white schools are just as segregated as all-Black or all-Hispanic schools and that segregation is about more than just the race or ethnicity of students at a particular school. It’s also about the racial and ethnic demographics of a school’s community and the distribution of students across schools in a district.
        </p>
        <p>
        As the US becomes more racially diverse and education systems evolve, we need measures of segregation that help education leaders develop solutions that will have the biggest impact. By better understanding school segregation, we can find better ways to address it.
        </p>
        <p>
        That’s why we created the Segregation Contribution Index (SCI), which measures how much individual schools contribute to racial segregation in their broader systems.
        </p>
      </div>
    <div id='sections'>
      <section class="step firstStep">
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Take, for instance, <span class="selectedSchool">Tamarack Waldorf School</span> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a private school where 36 percent of its middle school students are Black or Hispanic (the school serves students from kindergarten through eighth grade).
        </p>
        <p>
        Using common measures of segregation (which often define schools as intensely segregated if less than 10 percent of enrolled students are white), Tamarack wouldn’t be considered particularly segregated.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        But that number alone doesn’t consider the racial composition of the school’s district. Compared with the Milwaukee school district, in which the Black or Hispanic enrollment share among middle school students is 80 percent, <span class="selectedSchool">Tamarack</span> has a much smaller share of Black or Hispanic students.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        We can look at all 171 middle schools in the Milwaukee school district to see how their racial composition compares with districtwide enrollment. <span class="selectedSchool">Tamarack</span> is on the far left of this distribution, which means it enrolls a smaller share of Black or Hispanic students than most district middle schools.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        To determine whether a school is segregated, rather than looking only at its share of Black or Hispanic students, we can consider how changing that share would affect integration in the district. Our SCI, derived from the dissimilarity index, assigns each school a percentage that shows how much segregation in the district would fall if that school’s racial composition matched the district’s.
        </p>
        <p>
        If all schools in a district were the same size, their SCI percentages would directly correlate to how much <span class="belowAvgSchool">smaller</span> or <span class="aboveAvgSchool">larger</span> their shares of Black or Hispanic students are from the district’s share.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        But size is also a factor, because changing a larger school’s racial composition affects a bigger share of the district’s students. To calculate each school’s SCI value, we account for the difference in the share of Black or Hispanic students between the school and its district, as well as enrollment. That percentage reflects the share of districtwide segregation that can be attributed to the individual school.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this case, <span class="selectedSchool">Tamarack</span> has an SCI value of 1.6 percent. That means if the school’s racial composition were replaced with a composition that matched the Milwaukee School District’s middle school enrollment, segregation in the district would fall 1.6 percent. Tamarack enrolls 280 middle school students. If it were bigger, it would contribute even more to district segregation because changing the school’s racial composition would involve more students.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        So how does this change how we typically think about school segregation?
        </p>
        <p>
        Traditional measures of segregation that look only at a school’s racial composition may miss schools that look vastly different from their districts, and these measures don’t quantify how much each school contributes to broader system segregation.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">

        <p>
        Our measure looks at segregation at the district level and treats schools as parts of a whole: each school contributes a certain share to total segregation in the broader system.
        </p>
        <p>
        Beyond that, our SCI shifts conventional thinking about which schools are considered segregated. Absolute measures of segregation are often based solely on whether schools enroll a certain share of white students and, as a result, only flag schools that predominantly enroll large shares of Black or Hispanic students as segregated.
        </p>
        <p>
        But using our new measure, we see that many <span class="belowAvgSchool">schools with a smaller share of Black or Hispanic students</span> than the district average contribute just as much—or even more—to segregation as schools with a <span class="aboveAvgSchool">larger share of Black or Hispanic students</span>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        In the Milwaukee school district, <span class="belowAvgSchool">55</span> of the 171 middle schools have a <span class="belowAvgSchool">smaller share of Black or Hispanic students</span> than the district average. Even though these schools enroll only 30 percent of all district middle school students, they account for 50 percent of the district’s segregation.

  <p>
  Of course, neighborhoods are often severely racially segregated, which drives a large part of school segregation patterns. But residential segregation doesn’t explain everything. In many cases, the racial composition of students who attend schools in the area around a given school is vastly different from that school’s enrollment. Among the schools within one mile of Tamarack, 82 percent of middle school students are Black or Hispanic.
  </p>
  <p>
  That difference shows that transportation isn’t the only barrier for students who could attend a school. School catchment zones, as well as other factors like tuition, entrance exams, school choice policies, and parent preferences also contribute to these enrollment patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
  To drive greater change, policymakers and district officials concerned about segregation can use this improved measure to target desegregation efforts at schools where changes would have the biggest impact on the district, and at structural factors that may impede integration.

                      Enrollment data on race or ethnicity for every US public school comes from the National Center for Education Statistics’ Common Core of Data School Universe Survey. We use 2015 data when studying school contributions to segregation. To examine the role of private schools, we use the Private School Universe Survey, which includes about 75 percent of US private schools. Our analysis uses the same racial and ethnic terms as those in the Common Core of Data, including the term “Hispanic” to refer to Hispanic or Latinx students.

                      We argue that desegregation efforts should focus where inequities in student achievement have been documented. Evidence shows that, on average, structural factors have led Black and Hispanic students to persistently score lower on standardized examinations than white and Asian students. Thus, we measure school segregation as the separation of Black and Hispanic students from white and Asian students (and the relatively small share of students from other racial or ethnic groups). Because of this choice, the SCI should not be used to determine whether schools that predominantly enroll students from other groups (e.g., American Indian or Alaska Native) are segregated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We recognize the limitations of grouping Black and Hispanic students together, as these students have different experiences in education systems. We also recognize the limitations of grouping white and Asian students together, as data aggregation for subpopulations of Asian students can obscure disparities among people from different ethnic groups. We include students from other groups (e.g., Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, and two or more races) with the white and Asian groups to simplify calculations, but we recognize the limitations of this choice as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To focus only on school systems that have a reasonable chance for integration, we do not include systems that have only one school per level, enroll fewer than 200 students, or are less than 5 percent Black or Hispanic. For our school-level designations, elementary school includes kindergarten through 5th grade, middle school includes grades 6–8, and high school includes grades 9–12.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To group schools into districts, we use data on geographic school district boundaries from the 2015 release of the National Center for Education Statistics’ Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates. To find neighboring schools, we draw a one-mile radius around each school and define school neighborhood composition as the Black and Hispanic share of students attending schools serving the same grades within this radius, including the students in the school of interest. For schools with no same-grade neighboring schools within one mile, our algorithm expands the search radius progressively by one mile until a neighboring school is found or 15 miles are reached with no neighbors, at which point we say the school has no neighbors. See our report for more information about SCI at the neighborhood level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The SCI is defined within school systems, so comparisons across systems should account for differences in demographics, size, and other factors. The SCI value changes when considering different systems, which, in addition to districts (as described above), can be counties or metropolitan areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This index does not demonstrate causal relationships and should not be used to assign blame to individual schools or types of schools. If one school significantly contributes to segregation, closing it will not necessarily better integrate the system because those students might sort into other schools in ways that exacerbate segregation.
                    </p>
